            At Black Gold Seal Coat, a leader in asphalt maintenance, we encountered a significant challenge familiar to many contractors: acquiring quality leads was not only expensive but often unreliable. Traditional platforms charged exorbitant fees, making it especially difficult for new contractors to gain traction in a competitive industry.

            We saw an opportunity to create something better—a platform that could connect trusted contractors with clients in need of dependable outdoor services while also supporting contractors, both new and established, in growing their businesses.
